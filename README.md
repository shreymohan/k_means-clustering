# Clustering Analysis

## K-means Clustering

* First the K means clustering is implemented from scratch.
* K means clustering is then performed to analyze what kind of data we have with us.
* The first dataset is the iris dataset which has 3 kinds of flowers with 4 features.
* The second dataset used is the one which has 2 kinds of tumours with 20 features.
* The implemented algorithm successfully distinguishes between different kinds of data in the dataset.
